AI-Powered Resume Analyzer & Job Matcher is a full-stack web application 🤖 that uses AI and NLP to analyze resumes 📄 and recommend suitable jobs 💼. Users can upload their resumes via a React frontend 🌐, which sends the file to a Java Spring Boot backend ⚙️. The backend extracts text and sends it to a Python microservice 🐍 that identifies key skills 🧠 using NLP. Based on these skills, it suggests matching job roles 🏢, which are then displayed in the UI. The project demonstrates full-stack integration, microservices, and real-world AI applications, making it an excellent portfolio project for showcasing software and AI skills.
